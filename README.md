## I built a classic 'Space Invaders' Game using the built-in Python library Pygame.

### Instructions :-
  1. Press -> and <- arrow keys to move the player's spaceship right and left respectively.
  2. Press space bar to shoot a bullet upwards.
  3. Once an enemy ship reaches near the bottom line, the Game ends.
