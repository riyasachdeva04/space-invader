## I built a classic 'Space Invaders' Game using the built-in Python library Pygame.


## Usage

```bash
pip install python

```

```bash
pip install pygame

```

```bash
python main.py

```

## Instructions :-
  #### 1. Press -> and <- arrow keys to move the player's spaceship right and left respectively.
  #### 2. Press space bar to shoot a bullet upwards.
  #### 3. Once an enemy ship reaches near the bottom line, the Game ends.
